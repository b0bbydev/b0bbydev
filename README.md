My name is Bobby Jonkman and I'm currently a student studying Computer Programming Analysis. I'm passionate about creating open-source projects and using technology to elevate our community and the people involved. Some of the technologies that I enjoy working with include NodeJS (Javascript + APIs), Java and PHP.
